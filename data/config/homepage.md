I am a Software/Web Engineer currently working at Garaji,
a small startup in Dubai looking to transform how you buy and insure your car 
using React, Node, Redux and Typescript (to name just a few).
I previously worked at Trainline & BBC News in full stack roles. 

I'm a keen developer, always looking to learn about new technologies
and how it improve both the development and user experience. Feel
free to take a look at my [CV](/cv), I'm always interested in
hearing about new opportunities.
