I am a Software/Web Engineer currently working at Trainline,
transforming the travel experience of people across the EU
using React, Node, Redux and Typescript (to name just a few).
I previously worked at BBC News working primarily on the
isomorphic React application [Simorgh](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh). 

I'm a keen developer, always looking to learn about new technologies
and how it improve both the development and user experience. Feel
free to take a look at my [CV](/cv), I'm always interested in
hearing about new opportunities.
