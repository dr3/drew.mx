I am a Software Engineer currently working at BBC News, after
spending time across PHP, Ruby and React microservices I now
focus primarily on the isomorphic React application
[Simorgh](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh). 

I'm a keen developer, always looking to learn about new technologies
and how it improve both the development and user experience. Feel
free to take a look at my [CV](/cv), I'm always interested in
hearing about new opportunities.
